The term "linearity" in algebra refers to a linear relationship between two or more variables.
 If we draw this relationship in a two-dimensional space (between two variables, in this case), 
we get a straight line. Let's consider a scenario where we want to determine the linear relationship 
between the numbers of hours a student studies and the percentage of marks that student scores in an exam. 
We want to find out that given the number of hours a student prepares for a test, about how high of a score can the student achieve.
